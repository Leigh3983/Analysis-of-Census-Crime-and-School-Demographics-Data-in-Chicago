# Analysis-of-Census-Crime-and-School-Demographics-in-Chicago
### I use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographics data sets, with the intention of finding meaningful insights to help improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the city of Chicago.
### I identify and study the causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools in order to understand what elements need to be changed, focused on more or less, and which elements are more critical.

# Analysis of Census, Crime, and School Demographics in Chicago using SQL

I used SQL to query census, crime, and school demographics data sets, with the purpose of finding meaningful insights that can help improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the city of Chicago.

I identified and analyzed the causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, and environment ratings of schools in order to understand which elements need to be changed, focused on more or less, and which are most critical.
